The "Beautiful Backgrounds" library offers a collection of customizable web components designed to enhance web pages with visually appealing animated backgrounds. Easy to integrate and use, these components are perfect for adding dynamic and interactive elements to your web applications.

[EXAMPLES][examples]

## Features

- **Multiple Background Components**: A variety of background components, each offering unique visual effects.
- **Customizable and Interactive**: Each component comes with customizable properties to suit different design needs.
- **Responsive and Efficient**: Components are responsive to screen size changes and optimized for performance.

## Installation

Using [`npm`][npm]:

```sh
npm i beautiful-backgrounds --save
```

```js
import { BbStarTrail } from "beautiful-backgrounds";
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { BbStarTrail } from "https://esm.sh/beautiful-backgrounds";
</script>
```

## Usage

### [Concentric Pulse](https://github.com/niekes/beautiful-backgrounds/blob/main/src/components/concentricPulse.ts)

Concentric rings around the center that breathe in a staggered wave while their colors flow outwards through a gradient. You can tune the ring count, spacing, pulse amplitude, speed and colors, from a calm deep-sea glow to a bright neon look.
